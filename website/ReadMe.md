This website aims to increase speed while editing locally downloaded VOD files.
Ideally, most interactions should come from the keyboard and should generate a compatible config file for use.
If you want to run it locally, download [nginx](http://nginx.org/en/download.html) and edit the included config to correctly point to your directories.
