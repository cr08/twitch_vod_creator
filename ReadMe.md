# TwitchVault
Simplified tool to automatically archive VODs, clips, highlights, including associated chat logs for specified Twitch channels
***
## Concept
My personal goal has been to find or develop a tool that can not only automate archiving the latest VODs, clips, and highlights from selected Twitch channels, but also archiving the chat logs as they are available for each medium.
